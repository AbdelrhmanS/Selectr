# Selectr
A lightweight dependency-free select box replacement written in vanilla javascript. 2.8kb minified and gzipped.

Features:

* Supports single and multiple select boxes
* Supports optgroups
* Tagging support
* Searchable options
* Ajax options
* Custom events
* Custom styling
* Much more...

Selectr is so feature-packed that it needs it's own documentation site so why not head over there now - [Demos & Documentation](https://mobius1.github.io/Selectr/)

### Roadmap

Selectr started out as a plugin I wrote for personal use to replace Select2 on my sites due to me dumping jQuery. This means that it isn't as streamlined as I'd like it to be for distribution. Therefore, in the coming months I'll be working on vastly improving Selectr.

### Changelog


### v1.0.5
* Pagination option added for large datasets when using options.data
* Fixed bug that caused a problem with deselecting programmatically set value (needed to be clicked twice to deselect)
* Various bug fixes



### v1.0.4

* `render` option deprecated and replaced with `renderOption` (see [docs](https://mobius1.github.io/Selectr/docs/options/renderOption.html))
* add option `renderSelection` (see [docs](https://mobius1.github.io/Selectr/docs/options/renderSelection.html))
